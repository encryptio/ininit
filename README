DESCRIPTION

    ininit is a program that allows the user to write Lua scripts that read
    audio files, do processing, play back certain signals in real time, save
    audio files, or any combination of those. It is meant to be simple and
    powerful, and avoids unnecessary complexity for the sole sake of
    performance.

DOWNLOADING

    The recommended way to get ininit is through git.
        
    $ git clone git://github.com/encryptio/ininit.git

    A tarball of the latest development version is avaliable at
    <http://github.com/encryptio/ininit/tarball/master> (save as .tar.gz)

BUILDING

    Both Lua 5.1 and libsndfile must be installed and the pkg-config files
    associated with them accessible by pkg-config (this is usually automatic.)
    The build system, SCons, must be installed and in the PATH. Perl is used
    to build the documentation and to build the main binary's Lua functions.

    Lua is avaliable at <http://www.lua.org/>
    libsndfile is avaliable at <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>
    SCons is avaliable at <http://www.scons.org/>

    Most likely, your UNIX-like system already has a working Perl. If not,
    Perl is avaliable at <http://www.perl.org/>

    Once you have the prerequisites, building the program is extremely simple:

    $ cd ininit
    $ scons

    And you're done!

INSTALLATION

    Installation is less simple, as it must be done by hand. The binary "ininit"
    should be in the same directory as the source code if you followed the
    BUILDING instructions. This binary must be placed in your $PATH.
    
    The recommended way for an unprivileged user to do this is to symlink ininit
    into ~/bin, then add ~/bin to your $PATH if it's not already there.

    $ ln -s /path/to/ininit/sourcedir/ininit ~/bin/ininit

    This allows easy updating, assuming you're using git to follow the
    development tree:

    $ git pull
    $ scons

    Without copying any files. Since the symlink points to the named file in the
    source directory, the new version will be used automatically.

    If, however, you have administrator access, you may install it by copying it
    into a system binary directory, such as /usr/local/bin.

    # cp ./ininit /usr/local/bin/ininit

DOCUMENTATION

    is minimal, unfortunately. A reference guide to the Lua function calls
    specific to ininit are described in docs/lua.txt, avaliable only after the
    program has been built. Examples of scripts that do work are in examples/ in
    the source distribution.

USAGE

    $ ininit script.lua

    Extra arguments may be passed to the script by appending them after the script name.

LICENSING

    This program is released under the three-clause BSD license.

    ininit links with libsndfile, a program licensed under the LGPL. Libsndfile
    is available at <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>, and is primarily the
    work of Erik de Castro Lopo.  

    ininit also links with Lua, the scripting language used in this program to
    procedurally describe signal flows. Lua is avaliable at <http://www.lua.org/>
